#  React Portfolio
​
## Description 
​This React app is a portfolio showcasing my projects and skills in building web-based applications.

The portfolio includes a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
The header includes my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume with images of applications I've built with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
When the user moves the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text or having a proper email address, they receive a notification that this field is required, or they've entered an invalid email address, respectively.
The Resume section links to a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies, and the footer includes links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn profiles.​
