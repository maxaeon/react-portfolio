          Hi! I'm M. A. Parks (preferred name 'Max', legal name 'Megan'). I am a front-end web developer leveraging an extensive philosophy and psychology background to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. I’m currently working toward a certificate in full stack development from Michigan State University with newly developed skills in a variety of technologies and languages. I’m known as an innovative problem solver passionate about web development, with a focus on accessibility. 
          With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. For example, I recently worked on a team of four to develop a single-page COVID-19 informational app that helps individuals in the COVID-19 pandemic access reliable information about national, continental, and state data. I also worked as part of a team to create a full-stack web application which allows users to track various farm activities and plant, animal, and weather information. I’m looking forward to using my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web. I’m looking to collaborate on website development and other projects to improve my skillset.
